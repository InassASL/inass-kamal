Hi, I'm Inass Kamal.
I am a PhD student in Biomedical Optics at École Polytechnique in France.  
My research focuses on the use of Mueller polarimetry and deep learning–based segmentation methods.  
I am particularly interested in multimodal AI approaches that integrate different sources of data.  
My work aims at advancing early disease detection through explainable and clinically relevant AI solutions.
